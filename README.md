# Pong game

## Game summary

This game is inspired by Pong. The player controls a platform using the left and right keys on their keyboard to prevent the ball from falling into the pit. If the ball falls, the game restarts. Each time the ball bounces on the platform, the player scores a point. After 10 points, the level increases, as does the speed of the ball. After three levels, the player wins the game and can restart if they wish.
